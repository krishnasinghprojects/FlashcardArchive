How do you detect a deadlock using a resource allocation graph?,"A deadlock can be detected by searching for cycles in the resource allocation graph. If a cycle exists, deadlock has occurred."
How can deadlock be prevented using mutual exclusion?,Deadlock can be prevented by ensuring that resources that cannot be shared are not allocated in a way that causes circular waiting.
How can deadlock be prevented using hold and wait?,"Hold and wait can be prevented by requiring processes to request all resources at once, avoiding the situation where a process holds one resource while waiting for others."
How can deadlock be prevented using no preemption?,"No preemption can be avoided by allowing processes to release resources when they are waiting for others, or forcibly taking resources from a process to avoid circular waiting."
How can deadlock be prevented using circular wait?,"Circular wait can be avoided by imposing an ordering on resources and requiring processes to request resources in a specific order, preventing the possibility of circular waiting."
How does the Banker's algorithm avoid deadlock?,"The Banker's algorithm avoids deadlock by checking if a resource request can be granted without putting the system in an unsafe state. If granting the request would lead to an unsafe state, it is denied."

What is the producer-consumer problem?,"The producer-consumer problem is a classic synchronization problem where producers create data and place it in a shared buffer, while consumers take data from the buffer. The challenge is to coordinate access to the shared buffer. Ques. 411. How can semaphores be used to solve the producer- consumer problem? Answer: Semaphores can be used to control access to the buffer by maintaining two semaphores: i. empty: Keeps track of the number of empty slots in the buffer. ii. full: Keeps track of the number of filled slots in the buffer. iii. A mutex is also used to ensure mutual exclusion while accessing the buffer."
What is the reader-writer problem?,"The reader-writer problem involves managing access to a shared resource where multiple readers can access the resource concurrently, but writers require exclusive access. 46"
How do semaphores help in solving the reader-writer problem?,"Semaphores can be used to allow multiple readers to access the resource simultaneously while ensuring exclusive access for writers. The typical solution involves two semaphores: i. mutex: Ensures mutual exclusion when reading/writing. ii. write_sem: Controls access to the resource by writers, ensuring that no other readers or writers are accessing it."
What is the classic solution to the producer-consumer problem using semaphores?,The solution involves using three semaphores: i. mutex: Ensures mutual exclusion when accessing the buffer. ii. empty: Indicates how many empty slots are available in the buffer. iii. full: Indicates how many filled slots are in the buffer.
What are the steps involved in the producer's process in the producer-consumer problem?,The producer performs the following steps: (cid:0) Decrease the empty semaphore to indicate an available slot. (cid:0) Lock the mutex to ensure mutual exclusion while accessing the buffer. (cid:0) Add the item to the buffer. (cid:0) Increase the full semaphore to indicate a filled slot. (cid:0) Release the mutex.
What are the steps involved in the consumer's process in the producer-consumer problem?,The consumer performs the following steps: (cid:0) Decrease the full semaphore to indicate a filled slot. (cid:0) Lock the mutex to ensure mutual exclusion while accessing the buffer. (cid:0) Remove the item from the buffer. (cid:0) Increase the empty semaphore to indicate an empty slot. (cid:0) Release the mutex.
How does the readers-writers problem differ from the producer- consumer problem?,"The reader-writer problem involves managing concurrent read and write operations to a shared resource, while the producer-consumer problem focuses on coordinating the production and consumption of items in a shared buffer. 47"
What is the role of the write_sem semaphore in the reader-writer problem?,"The write_sem semaphore is used to ensure that when a writer is accessing the resource, no other readers or writers can access the resource, providing exclusive access to the writer."
What is a common issue with the readers-writers problem?,"A common issue is the ""starvation"" of writers, where readers continuously access the resource, preventing writers from obtaining exclusive access."
How can starvation be prevented in the reader-writer problem?,Starvation can be prevented by giving writers priority or using a fair scheduling algorithm that ensures writers eventually get a chance to write.
Can semaphores be used for solving the dining philosophers problem?,"Yes, semaphores can be used to solve the dining philosophers problem by ensuring mutual exclusion while eating and managing the resources (forks) effectively."
What is a deadlock condition in the context of the producer- consumer problem?,"Deadlock in the producer-consumer problem can occur if both the producer and consumer processes wait indefinitely for each other to release the buffer, causing no progress."
What can be done to avoid deadlock in the producer-consumer problem?,Deadlock can be avoided by ensuring that all processes acquire semaphores in the same order and by using timeouts or deadlock detection mechanisms.
What is a possible solution to avoid starvation in the reader-writer problem?,"A possible solution is to implement a ""fair"" or ""priority"" scheduling mechanism, ensuring that no process is indefinitely delayed by the other processes. Ques. 425. What are condition variables and how are they used in synchronization? 48 Answer: Condition variables are used to synchronize threads, allowing them to wait for certain conditions to be met before proceeding. They are often used in conjunction with mutexes."

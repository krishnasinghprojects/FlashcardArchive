What is the Role of an Index in Query Performance?,Indexes improve query performance by reducing the time required to locate data.
What is a Full-Text Search Index?,A specialized index that allows fast text-based searching within documents.
What is the Difference Between Vertical and Horizontal Scaling in Databases?,"Vertical Scaling: Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to a single server. • Horizontal Scaling: Adding more servers to distribute the load. •"
What is the Purpose of Database Partitioning?,"To split a large table into smaller, more manageable parts for better performance and scalability."
What is a Hybrid Database?,A database that combines SQL and NoSQL capabilities to handle diverse workloads.
What is a Hybrid Database?,A database that combines SQL and NoSQL capabilities to handle diverse workloads.
What is the difference between OLTP and OLAP?,"OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) is optimized for transactional workloads, while OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) is designed for complex analytical queries."
Define NoSQL databases.,"NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed for scalability and flexibility, handling unstructured and semi-structured data."
What are the different types of NoSQL databases?,"Key-Value Store, Document Store, Column-Family Store, and Graph Database."
What is eventual consistency in NoSQL?,"A consistency model ensuring that, given enough time, all replicas of data will become consistent. 27"
Explain ACID properties in database transactions.,"Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability ensure reliable transaction processing."
What is BASE in NoSQL databases?,"BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) is an alternative to ACID for highly distributed systems."
What is the CAP theorem?,"It states that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of three: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance."
Differentiate between vertical and horizontal scaling in databases.,"Vertical scaling enhances a single server’s capacity, whereas horizontal scaling distributes data across multiple servers."
What is sharding in databases?,A database partitioning technique that distributes data across multiple servers to improve performance and scalability.
Explain the difference between RANK() and DENSE_RANK() functions.,RANK() assigns ranks with gaps for ties; DENSE_RANK() assigns consecutive ranks without gaps.
What is the purpose of the GROUPING SETS clause?,"GROUPING SETS allows multiple groupings in a single query, providing more control over aggregations."
How do you handle NULL values in aggregate functions?,Aggregate functions like SUM() and AVG() ignore NULLs; functions like COUNT() can include or exclude NULLs based on syntax.
What is a phantom read in database transactions?,A phantom read occurs when a transaction reads new rows that were committed by another transaction after the initial read.
Explain the concept of a two-phase commit protocol.,A protocol that ensures all participating databases in a distributed transaction agree to commit or rollback changes.
What is optimistic concurrency control?,A concurrency control method that assumes multiple transactions 28 can complete without affecting each other and checks for conflicts before committing.
Describe the difference between shared locks and exclusive locks.,Shared locks allow multiple transactions to read a resource; exclusive locks allow only one transaction to modify a resource.
How does a database detect deadlocks?,Databases detect deadlocks by constructing a wait-for graph and checking for cycles.
What is the purpose of a transaction log?,A transaction log records all transactions and database modifications for recovery purposes.
Explain the concept of isolation levels in transactions.,Isolation levels define the degree to which a transaction must be isolated from data modifications made by other transactions.
What is write-ahead logging?,A process where changes are first recorded in a log before being applied to the database to ensure durability.
Describe the difference between pessimistic and optimistic locking.,Pessimistic locking locks resources to prevent conflicts; optimistic locking allows transactions to proceed and checks for conflicts before committing.
How can deadlocks be prevented in a database system?,"Deadlocks can be prevented by implementing proper locking hierarchy, timeout mechanisms, or deadlock detection algorithms."
What is a B-Tree index?,"A balanced tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time."
Explain the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes.,A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table; a non-clustered index is a separate structure that points to the data. 29
What is a hash index?,An index that uses a hash function to map keys to locations in a hash table for quick data retrieval.
Describe the concept of index fragmentation.,"Index fragmentation occurs when the logical order of pages does not match the physical order, leading to inefficient data retrieval."
How does a bitmap index work?,A bitmap index uses bitmaps for each distinct value and is efficient for columns with a low cardinality of distinct values.
What is the purpose of a covering index?,"A covering index includes all the columns needed to satisfy a query, eliminating the need to access the table data."
Explain the difference between dense and sparse indexes.,A dense index has an index entry for every search key value; a sparse index has index entries for only some of the search key values.
What is the role of fill factor in index creation?,"Fill factor determines the percentage of space on each leaf-level page to be filled with data, reserving space for future growth."
Describe the concept of index selectivity.,"Index selectivity is the measure of how well an index can distinguish between rows, calculated as the ratio of distinct key values to the total number of rows."
How does partitioned indexing improve query performance?,"Partitioned indexing divides an index into smaller, more manageable pieces, allowing queries to scan only relevant partitions and improving performance."
"What is the difference between TRUNCATE, DELETE, and DROP?",Command Deletes Rows Can Rollback? Removes Table? DELETE Yes (selected rows) ✅ Yes ❌ No TRUNCATE Yes (all rows) ❌ No ❌ No DROP Yes (entire table) ❌ No ✅ Yes 30
How does a DBMS ensure concurrency control?,"Through locking mechanisms, like two-phase locking (2PL) • Timestamp ordering • Isolation levels (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable • Read, Serializable) 31"
